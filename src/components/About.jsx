          My name is Emily. I am a second year university student 
          studying Computer Science. I will be using this website to showcase all the projects 
          I have done throughout the years and tell the stories behind them.

          You may have noticed the name of this website is emfie. Emfie is a 
          nickname my friends came up with. It is a combination of my first name, Emily
          and my dog's name, Alfie. Since this domain name was avaliable, 
          I decided turn emfie into my personal website where I can share my work.
